Plan For My Game

All players, alive or dead, are teleported to the lobby immediately after the event ends.

A countdown starts automatically (20 → 0) for the next round.

After the countdown, all players get teleported to TweenPart.

The disaster duration can be different for every type of event, so the function should not rely on fixed timing — it should trigger only after the event signals it is done.
