I ACTUALLY HAVE A BINDABLE EVENT CALLED "Wait" LOCATED TO REPLICATEDSTORAGE SO ADD THAT!!!
AFTER ALL OF THIS JUST REQUIRE THE MODULE AND IT WILL WORK!!

The WaitModule located to ReplicatedStorage:

local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local module = {}

task.wait(3)
local waitEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Wait")
waitEvent:Fire()

return module
